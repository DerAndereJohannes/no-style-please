{: data-content="My Links"}

Since it is impossible to find a decent domain name that is still available, finding one always makes me happy! To show off the domains portfolio of domains I own and used to own, I have curated a small table to sum up my domain history:

| Domain        | Description           |
|:-------------:|:---------------------:|
| <a href="https://herforth.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">herforth.xyz</a> | This website. A cheap tld so that I can guarantee that I can afford it.  |
| <a href="https://node.lu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">node.lu</a> | Short and simple name. I would love to run a matrix instance based on it (when I have experimented around with dendrite). It is still used as an alias. |
| <a href="https://shogi.lu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shogi.lu</a> | Shogi is the Japanese version of chess. Imagine chess, but the game rarely ends in a draw. I tried to get a group going in Luxembourg, but interest for it is sure difficult to capture. |
| <a href="https://searcher.lu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">searcher.lu</a> | Search engine used in season 2 of Capitani. I thought it was a fun idea to try and recreate the front page in case anyone decides to type the domain in their browser :-) |
| okonomiyaki.jp | A savory pancake dish. Popular Kansai Japanese street food. (No longer owned) |
