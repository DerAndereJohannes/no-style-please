I don't think my room has changed at all since I moved here in the early 2000s.
Have I decided to move things around? Sure! Have I replaced the objects that
broke? Yes! However, when it comes to documents from school, personal
finances to Christmas cards, I (should) still have all of them somewhere here. This means
that I have papers in my room that are over 20 years old and not really doing
much. I strongly believe, that reading and writing on physical paper is superior
to electronic copies in the majority of cases, however I have finally got the idea that
keeping ALL of them is just not scalable to maintain.

Regardless, I still do want to keep and organize the papers I have for when/if I
do need them in the future. Consequently, I have come up with an idea
that the German government could never come up with... Digitalization!

To combat this task, I wanted to create the most optimal setup for scanning
1000s of pages without breaking my back. After taking a while to research the
topic (a story for another time), I finally concluded with buying an automatic
document feeder (ADF) scanner. More specifically, the **Brother ADS-4300Â N** [^1]. 

The main points which made me select it are the following points:
* Native Linux support through SANE
* Ethernet port (!!!!)
* No screen, dedicated physical buttons instead

I was very unsure of how *good* the scanner would be as this particular model
has barely any coverage on any internet forum other than the official brother
pages. Overall, the scanner is placed in the middle of the line-up of Brother's
ADF scanners with the "upgraded" scanners ditching Ethernet for Wi-Fi and
including a front touch screen (An absolute recipe for disaster!). Because of
this, I thought it would be nice to give a short initial impression of the
scanner after scanning about 5 full binders of paper.

The scanner was easy to get out of the box and came with everything that you
need to get going other than an Ethernet cable (which I fortunately have plenty to spare).
While the physical setup was easy enough, it turned out to be slightly more
challenging on the software front. The included manual gives basic information
on what the different lights do on the scanner itself, but for using it from a
PC or phone, it promptly points you to an online setup. Although I have not
tried, I am sure that all the mainstream operating systems have an easy enough
interface provided by the applications downloaded through this method.

However, from the point of view of a Linux user, there are no further
instructions after downloading and installing the drivers for USB and network
use. You can also access some scanner setup options by connecting to the scanner
directly through its HTTP frontend. The web interface first tries to get you to
install a cert to enable HTTPS which makes sense given the features that the
description page boasts. However, this of course is always a bit suspicious as
you are trusting your security in a certificate that you did not create
yourself. Fortunately, you can also generate your own and import it through the
admin portal. Here you also have access to set up FTP/SFTP connections and
change the 3 custom buttons at the front of the machine. I have not tried this
yet, but this looks quite convenient, as I am able to set up the custom buttons for
family members so that they only have to press a button to get the result they want.

Where I have used the scanner is through the SANE interface. 
Having not tried out SANE before in my life, I was expecting a *slight* difficulty bump to the process. Luckily, the Arch wiki [^2] saves the day and provides very simple instructions on application frontends for SANE and the CLI options. I started out by using a GUI frontend where I could check quickly test out quality settings and see what is best for which content. I personally had the best GUI experience with `gscan2pdf` where it was just intuitive to use without reading any man pages. After I was happy with the performance, I decided to check out the command line interface (CLI) to see if scripting was an option to me. As is tradition, the Arch wiki [^2] saves the day and provides very simple instructions on the types of commands to expect through SANE.

Overall, I decided to dig deeper into the CLI option and found it
to be the easiest and simplest option to take full advantage of the scanner. For
reference, below is an image of the options provided by the brother scanner
directly:

With these options, it is easy enough to get a good archival scan by typing:
```sh
$ scanimage -d "$BROTHER_SCANNER" --format png --resolution 300 --MultifeedDetection=yes --AutoDocumentSize=yes --AutoDeskew=yes --batch "%d.png"
```

With all these options available, I created a simple script that creates
optimal defaults considering the scan type (archive document, image print,
receipt, etc...) with the option to override them through command flags. What
this means (as seen in the command above), is that I can execute `bscan archive` to scan the documents at
300 DPI, in colour with the document auto cut and aligned as one would expect in
an archival version. The scanner works perfectly with the script, and it was a
delight to see everything run so smoothly! All I can say is that I am chuffed!

My first impression of the scanning process is generally very positive. I
load up the documents I want to scan, I type my command for the specific quality
settings and off it goes!

I am doing everything through an Ethernet connection (PC and scanner are both
connected via cable). The time it takes for the scanner to react is almost
instantaneous. 

*Side Rant: If I compare this to the older Brother printer that we also have
here (Wi-Fi only) it is night and day. I really don't get why you would want to
equip a stationary tool with Wi-Fi over Ethernet. Once again I just have to ask
what went wrong when they decided that the "higher end" models are only equipped
with Wi-Fi.* 

The only part I did not expect to be slow is the actual processing of the scans
and the transfer back to the PC. While I do believe that the scanner can do 40
pages a minute (I have not tested this, perhaps I should), the processing of the
pages takes quite a bit longer and so my terminal is hung up a while longer
while the pages load. This is perhaps not a too bad of a problem though, since
removing the scanned documents and loading new pages usually takes long enough
for the processing to finish.

Since this is the first ADF system that I have bought for home use, I can not
really compare the quality between competitors or other models. Nevertheless, I
found that the scanner does do a good job with documents. Even when taking 300
DPI PNGs (my default setting for archive mode), the only way to see compression
artifacts and individual pixels is to really zoom in! The contrast between the
white paper and the colour on top (even faint colours like red or light pencil)
show even better on my monitor.

In addition to documents, I also tried scanning old printed images where the
negatives were thrown away ( Please don't throw them away :-( ). The pictures
tested were printed on pretty standard glossy 4" x 6" photo paper. Initially, I was
worried that the feed would not be able to separate the pictures, and it would
cause problems with feeding them through. To my surprise, after entering my
specific "photo scan" command, they just went through normally one by one. The
results of these scans were a bit more mixed. The images with a lot of light
positively surprised me with how decent it looked. On the contrary, images which
were more dark had more problems with getting details compared to the original. In addition, some images were not cut properly and so the scanner bed can sometimes still be seen in the file.

The one factor that I did not think about before purchasing an ADF, is the
maintenance that is required for the best quality scans (Not the fault of the product itself). In hindsight, I perhaps
was being a bit too naive. When I set it up, I immediately placed a dust cover
over the scanner to prevent any from going in. However, what I did not think of
is all the paper dust(?) that is on the paper itself. Whether this is due to the
age of the paper that I had placed into the scanner, or if it has to do with the
quality of paper that I used in some of my binders is not clear to me.
Regardless, the scans can be affected by this "paper dust" that sometimes places
itself on the scanner portion. This can create very small and then black lines
on the scan which can be annoying on some more important documents that you want
to be kept perfectly. Interestingly, the dark streak sometimes fixes itself
after more paper is fed through, but I also got used to opening up the scanner
and giving it a good clean with microfiber cloth and my Rocket air blower.


Other than that, my first impressions remain very positive. Especially
coming from a Linux background where companies usually just don't care about the
operating system, the implementation in SANE was the best solution that Brother
could do! My next task is to really put the scanner to the test. I still have boxes full of binders and
photos to be scanned before I can really make my final judgement on it, but I
can tell that this will be a project that will be ongoing for another while.
I will probably comment on those results again.
