Since it is impossible to find a decent domain name that is still available, finding one always makes me happy! To show off the domains portfolio of domains I own and used to own, I have curated a small table to sum up my domain history:

| Domain        | Description           | Available for sale  |
|:-------------:|:---------------------:|:-------------------:|
| <a href="https://node.lu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">node.lu</a> | Short and simple name. Node.js is a very popular javascript runtime and the name is also used in many other areas of computer science | Yes |
| <a href="https://shogi.lu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shogi.lu</a> | Shogi is the Japanese version of chess. Imagine chess, but the game rarely ends in a draw. | No |
| <a href="https://searcher.lu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">searcher.lu</a> | Search engine used in season 2 of Capitani. | Yes |
| okonomiyaki.jp | A savory pancake dish. Popular Kansai Japanese street food. (No longer owned) | -- |
