	abstract = {Process mining techniques have proven crucial in identifying performance and compliance issues. Traditional process mining, however, is primarily case-centric and does not fully capture the complexity of real-life information systems, leading to a growing interest in object-centric process mining. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach for feature extraction from object-centric event logs. In contrast to established methods for feature extraction from traditional event logs, object-centric logs present a greater challenge due to the interconnected nature of events related to multiple objects. This paper addresses this gap by proposing techniques and tools for feature extraction specifically designed for object-centric event logs. In this work, we focus on features pertaining to the lifecycle of the objects and their interaction. These features enable a more comprehensive understanding of the process and its inherent complexities. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through its implementation in two significant areas: anomaly detection and throughput time prediction for objects in the process. Our results, based on four problems in a Procure-to-Pay process, affirm the potential of our proposed features in enhancing the scope of process mining. By effectively transforming object-centric event logs into numeric vectors, we pave the way for the application of a broader range of machine learning techniques, such as classification, prediction, clustering, and anomaly detection, thereby extending the capabilities of process mining.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality applications are witnessing increased adoption in mental and physical health fields, from rehabilitation therapies to psychological studies. The more advanced the application, the greater the demand to incorporate realistic, custom avatars based on the participant's physical characteristics to enhance embodiment. Current solutions focus on creating such avatars by using expensive camera arrays to capture a 3D representation, which requires technical skills and actively involves the participant in the process. However, equipment and space requirements, setup complexity for non-technical operators, and physical challenges for participants often lead to difficulties and high costs for consistent adherence. This paper presents A3Cplus, a tool to efficiently generate anatomically accurate avatars based solely on a small amount of participant phenotypic data. An optimized processing pipeline uses this data to manipulate specialized blend shapes automatically and mold a generic model into the correct dimensions. We provide illustrative examples of using our tool and discuss its general applicability to immersive avatar-based virtual environments that require a high degree of accuracy and embodiment.},
